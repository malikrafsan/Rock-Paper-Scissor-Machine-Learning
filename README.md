# Rock Paper Scissor Machine Learning
---
## Description
- This program is a machine learning program to predict image input from the user. Users will be asked to input a picture of their wrist doing a suit. This program will later give an output in the form of predictions whether the user's suit is rock, paper, or scissors.

- The dataset used to train this machine learning program is 2188 images. I used various libraries in developing this program, such as tensorflow, hard, numpy, matplotlib, shutil, zipfile, etc. This program use convolutional neural network (CNN) concepts with 4 convolutional layers.
